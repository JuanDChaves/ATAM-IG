      Bad Religion is an American punk rock band that formed in Los Angeles,
      California in 1980. The band's lyrics cover topics related to religion,
      politics, society, the media and science. Musically, they are noted for
      their melodic sensibilities and extensive use of three-part vocal
      harmonies. The band has experienced multiple line-up changes, with singer
      <strong style="margin: 10px">Greg Graffin</strong> being the band's only
      constant member, though fellow founding members Jay Bentley and Brett
      Gurewitz have also been with the band for most of their history, and
      guitarist Brian Baker has been a member of the group since 1994. Guitarist
      Mike Dimkich and drummer Jamie Miller have been members of the band since
      2013 and 2015 respectively. To date, Bad Religion has released seventeen
      studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three EPs, and
      two live DVDs. They are considered to be one of the best-selling punk rock
      acts of all time, having sold over five million albums worldwide.

      After gaining a large underground following and critical praise through
      their releases on Gurewitz's label Epitaph in the 1980s and early 1990s,
      Bad Religion experienced mainstream success after signing to the major
      label Atlantic in 1993, and along with California-based bands like Green
      Day, The Offspring, NOFX and Rancid, they were responsible for the punk
      rock revival movement of the 1990s. Their seventh studio album and
      Atlantic debut, Recipe for Hate (1993), peaked at number 14 on Billboard's
      Heatseekers chart, and spawned one of their most popular songs "American
      Jesus". The band's 1994 follow-up Stranger than Fiction was also very
      successful, and included the hit singles "Infected", "Stranger than
      Fiction" and the re-recorded version of "21st Century (Digital Boy)"; the
      album was later certified gold, both in the United States and Canada.

      Shortly before the release of Stranger than Fiction, Gurewitz left Bad
      Religion to run his label Epitaph on a full-time basis (in response to the
      success of the label's then-artists the Offspring and Rancid), and was
      replaced by Brian Baker. The band's success had slowly dwindled by the
      late 1990s, and after three more albums, they were dropped from Atlantic
      in 2001; this resulted in Bad Religion returning to Epitaph and Gurewitz
      rejoining the band. Since then, they have undergone a resurgence in
      popularity, with <em style="margin: 10px">"Sorrow"</em>, "Los Angeles Is
      Burning" and "The Devil in Stitches" being Top 40 hits on the US charts,
      and their sixteenth studio album True North (2013) becoming Bad Religion's
      first album to crack the top 20 on the Billboard 200 chart, where it
      peaked at number 19.The band's seventeenth and most recent studio album,
      Age of Unreason, was released on May 3, 2019,[8] and they are currently
      working on new material for their eighteenth studio album.
